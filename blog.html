            <p>On the home page all missing content was added. The icons missing from the about section were added and the code snip-its for the project viewer have also been added. I also added a description for each snip-it to provide some context. As of now the site design has been finalized and all missing content has been added, however I still have some ideas I am planning on implementing in the future. I would like to optimize this site for mobile devices by writing a separate style-sheet designed for mobile viewing. I would also like to implement syntax coloring in the project viewer. From now on I will be causally updating this site and implementing new features as schools about pick up the pace again.</p>

            <p>Hey, as you can see the whole site has been basically redesigned (or should I say properly designed). The main page now has some information about me and my projects, as well as an interactive code snip-it viewer. I still need to get some icons for the last two pictures in the about section as well as add a description box for the snip-it viewer. Overall I'm super happy with how the site is looking so far and am planning on continuously updating it as time permits. This blog page could also look better but one step at a time haha. Okay time to get back to the final study grind!</p>
